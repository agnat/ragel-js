Hi all,

Ragel and Node sounded like a combination too attractive to not have.
I've produced an alpha-quality patch to add JavaScript code generation
to Ragel. I've duplicated the Ruby code generation backend since it is
the only other scripting language Ragel supports and that seemed a
sensible idea. At present it only supports the most basic table code
generation strategy and it's only received the mildest testing from me.

If anyone would like to help me get this patch ship-shape before I
submit it to the Ragel developers I'd be most grateful. The patch as is
needs C++ code review and lots of JavaScript-emitting RL files for
testing purposes. There are tons of freely available RL files for all
sorts of interesting formats and protocols on the net and reworking them
to produce JS is normally straightforward. The diff includes a sample
Node script (examples/mailbox-js.rl) which implemets an mbox parser.
That may be helping in seeing how RL files are put together. If not
Ragel has an excellent manual document that covers more or less everything.

This seems to work nicely enough for me with the sample mailbox I fed it.
